    "# Advanced Movie/Music Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to do fancy editing with movies and sound, you probably need more serious software. This will vary by platform, but for movies on Mac, iMovie is a good basic option that comes with most new machines, Final Cut Pro has more options. For music, Garage Band does a lot of basic things, Logic has more functionality. If trying to combine a MIDI in your movie, it's probably not worth doing anything fancier than line them up by hand in the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Command Line Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a number of open-source, very capable packages that allow you to do your editing on the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "**DISCLAIMER: This will not work for everyone, and we can't hope to effectively troubleshoot people's platform/dependency issues.** The various libraries have great documentation. We can tell you what works for us on Mac, which you can feel free to use as a starting point. We use `timidity` for manipulating the MIDI files, and `ffmpeg` for the movies.\n",
