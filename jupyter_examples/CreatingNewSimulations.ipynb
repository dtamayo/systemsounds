Either way, this date is cached and used for all other objects that are added to the simulation. Note that running this cell this will overwrite any simulation with the same name!\n",

    "# Calculating The Pitches Of A Planetary System\n",
    "Once a simulation has been created, we can load it here and calculate the musical pitches associated with each planet. In WritingMIDIfile.ipynb, this algorithm is used to assign pitches to planets but the notes must be rounded to standard pitches to be expressed in MIDI. Here, we will see what the exact pitches would be without rounding. You may want to recever these frequencies by loading the MIDI file into a DAW (Garageband, Logic, ProTools), splitting the midi file into separate tracks for each note, and then using a pitch shifter plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the pithes of our system by choosing an arbitray base frequency for one of the planets and then calulating the pitches of the other planets relative to it. If you know the actual orbital period of one of the objects (this is likely different from the orbitla period within rebound), you can instead specify the number of octaves you'd like to increase the pitch by. As an example, we'll load majorchord.sim and scale the frequencies so that the outer planet corresponds to C4. You may notice that planets with exact whole number period ratios do not correspond to exact standard pitches due to the discrepency between 'Just' and 'Even' temperment."
